# finance-tracker-app

Implement a basic budgeting app layout with the following:

- Header with the app name
- Form to add a new transaction with fields for: 
  - Date (date picker)
  - Amount (number input)
  - Type (radio button for income/expense)
  - Category (dropdown with options like groceries, bills, salary, etc)
  - Add Transaction submit button
- Area to display list of transactions (just hard-code a few sample transactions for now)
- Some basic styling

Use relevant semantic HTML elements and Chakra UI components where appropriate.
